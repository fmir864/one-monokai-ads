# One Monokai theme for ADS

Based on [One Monokai Theme](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai) by [Joshua Azemoh](https://github.com/azemoh)

## Installation

Download [.vsix file](), open the command palette and select Extensions: Install from VSIX...
When installed change you Color Theme to `One Monokai` ...

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

### Suggestions

The theme does not use a custom font, but we prefer to use new Microsoft open source font ['Cascadia code'](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) with font Ligatures turn on. You can [customize your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to use it.
If you download and install  the font in your system , you can add this option to have a custom font:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "'Cascadia Code PL', 'Cascadia Mono PL'"
}
```
